# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
  jp.job_id,
  jp.job_title,
  jp.job_title_short,
  jp.job_location,
  jp.job_country,
  jp.job_schedule_type,
  jp.salary_year_avg,
  jp.job_posted_date,
  cd.name AS company_name,
  cd.link AS company_link
FROM 
  job_postings_fact AS jp
LEFT JOIN 
  company_dim AS cd 
ON 
  jp.job_id = cd.company_id
WHERE 
  jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
  AND jp.job_location = 'Anywhere' 
  AND jp.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
  AND cd.link IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
  jp.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
